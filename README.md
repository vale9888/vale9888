### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a AI & Machine Learning Intern at `J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.`, in the Equities Systematic Trading division. I am very passionate about the study and application of statistical and learning models to real world problems. 
- ðŸ”­ I have graduated cum Laude in Mathematical Engineering, minor in Statistical Learning, in October 2022. I developed my Master's Thesis in Visual Localization, leveraging the power of Self-Supervised Convolutional Neural Networks to improve the problem of accurate Pose Estimation.
